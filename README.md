## Project Overview

**FlatDango Movie Theater Booking** allows users to:
1. View a list of available movies.
2. Search for movies by title.
3. See details about each movie, including runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
4. Purchase tickets (with real-time availability updates).

The movie data is fetched from a server, and when a user buys a ticket, the server is updated to reflect the change in ticket availability.

## Features

- **Browse Movies**: View a list of available movies.
- **Search for Movies**: Use a search input to find movies by title.
- **Movie Details**: See detailed information such as runtime, showtime, available tickets, and a poster image.
- **Buy Tickets**: Purchase tickets for available movies (ticket count is updated in real time).
- **Sold Out Notifications**: Movies that have no available tickets will show a "Sold Out" message.
- **Showtime Information**: Movies now display their showtime in addition to the title and ticket availability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the web page.
- **CSS** for styling the page (in `style.css`).
- **JavaScript** for DOM manipulation, fetching data, and handling user interactions.
- **Fetch API** for making requests to the backend server.
- **Local server** (to be running locally on `http://localhost:3000/films`) to store and manage movie data.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flatdango-movie-theater.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
If you're setting up a local server to serve the movie data, ensure that your backend (e.g., a Node.js server) is running at `http://localhost:3000/films` and returns movie data in the specified format.

### 3. Start the Server
Ensure that your server is running. You can use the following command based on your server's setup:
```bash
 json-server --watch db.json
```
 - Ensure the server is serving movie data at `http://localhost:3000/films`.
 - Ensure the server is always running 

 ### 4. Open the App
Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the app:
```bash
open index.html
```
## Usage
- Browse Movies: After the page loads, you'll see a list of available movies in the movie list section.
